29153,this review is about the staff at this location. i visited this mcdonalds 09/24 around 6:30pm to pick it up my food. my wife did another mobile order and i just arrived and tried to explain to the manager (i think she was) i have another order that was not on the screen. she was rude and answer one order at the time of course the first order arrived and i was still standing waiting for the other one more than 15 min. another friendly girl (danisha i thinks was her name tried to help me out) and the manager stopped her and sent to carry other stuff in the back. she was in charge for drive thru and one spanish customer was making an order. danisha asked her to help and she said i cant. i was shocked about this->:negative

23381,"disappointing. mcdonalds is my standby for fast food. normally i get consistent food with decent, sometimes amazing service. i know its not going to the gourmet but better than waiting at an untested restaurant for more expensive and worse food. shrink-flation at its best. half filled fries. soda with no refills. seriously? especially now that a combo meal costs $9. at first i thought it was because the restaurant was newer but after looking at these review->:negative"
23825,we went here for breakfast. the place could have been cleaner and the staff seemed a bit clueless; they missed the coffee from our order and also missed some items from the order of people sitting next to us. you'd be much better off going to friendly's or dunkin donuts on international drive.->:negative

6293,"soooo slow!!!! came here to try and get a quick burger before my train (20min for departure) and these guys suck! no sense of urgency. it's supposed to be fast food...nothing in this place is fast. missed my train by 5min with me running to penn the whole way from here. garbage is the sum up for this location. if you're thinking about getting something quick before your travels, look elsewhere. you're better off going hungry than waiting for these lazy employees to do their job.->:negative"

16221,"my order is wrong every time; the most frustrating customer experience. i live near this new location and have visited 6 times since the remodel, and i've concluded that this location is a 120% mess. if all of my orders are wrong i can imagine thousands of others are driving off with incorrect purchases. i ask for no cheese every time, and guess what is in my order.. cheese. or my frys are half full, or the hashbrowns are completely missing, no syrup/ utensils are in the bag as requested. on 3 occasions we were told to pull ahead and park on the side while they remake my order, an employee brings out an incorrect order.. yes 3 times. today this ""new"" team member blatantly tells me to go in and take of it... what the hell? every other time i let the incorrect order slide, but today i decided to speak with the store manager. i let her know politely about all of my incorrect orders, and she replies ""sorry"", i then ask ""what is mcdonalds doing about this, its every time the order is wrong?"" she responds ""i'm so sorry""... i ask again and same response. meanwhile the woman next to me is asking about the replacement order that she put in ten minutes ago, they apologize to her and say they are going to reinput it.... this new location is a joke, its truly insane that a mcdonalds is operating like this, and its been a few months since their brand new building opened.->:negative"

23543,"zero starts! all tables were unattended. they were all dirty. food took a while. manager was yelling at staff to hurry up with food. i stood for a few minutes ready to place my order. i was the next client. no one. i mean. not a soul greeted me, acknowledge my presence or anything. not even an exchange of words when i got my food (which i had to order online from inside the restaurant because no one was there to help me). not a you're welcome when i said thanks. nothing!!! i would not come here again.->:negative"

20889,good->:positive
29269,it's fast food so its hit or miss. often the fry grease tastes old. the tea fluctuations in sweetness can throw you for a loop going anywhere from bitter to syrup. half the time late shifts miss part of your order and if they are busy sometimes the food especially fish and chicken wraps do not appear to be fully cooked. other times its great?->:negative

21593,high prices here they pay that strap price->:negative
27216,"worst customer service ever!! i was invited to come in after having to wait over 45 minutes on the drive thru. manager priscilla calls me to apologize and invites me back with my family, i explained i cannot come back next day, but would come following sunday, she agreed and hung up. on sunday i come to the restaurant and there is another manager cynthia who i explained the situation and she grunted the whole time she took the order. while on the service line, she tries to contact the manager and right there from behind the line, she asks me yelling, what is your name, i tell her and again in front of everyone, other customers included, yells again, ""she tells me you came in already!!"" i replied no, at this point i'm embarrassed and upset and i hear her that she tells the person on the phone i already put it down. twenty minutes later, i finally get the order. i ask her to change the fries on some of the things that were ready because they were cold. the manager grunts and agrees to. after my family were done with their meals, we had ordered ice cream and we asked to hold off until we were done. when we returned, we asked for the ice cream and we had asked for chocolate, they said that we had ordered vanilla and the manager gave us one less of what we ordered. incredible! bottom line, we were invited to come back to make it up for bad service and mcdonald's came through, we got yelled at by the manager, embarrased, long wait for food, missing food items, and pissy attitude by staff. next time i get invited back i guess i gotta read the fine print or ask for what am i invited to come back for. sorry that we don't have negative stars because this location would take them all.->:negative"

8466,this has to be the worst mcdonalds! the food is never hot and never fresh. i went there again tonight since it's the only place open. the fries were warm and tasted like they had been cooked in an air frier and the burger was cold and tasted like it had been sitting for hours. this places stays pretty busy so there is no excuse for poor quality of food imo. avoid unless it's your only option.->:negative

11915,"stuff is super polite and nice and helpful. 4 stars because if you pay at a kiosk, grab a receipt and a table number, find a place, proudly install the number on top of it and wait you are sort of in a limbo: your order is not shown on any display, you have no clue when and how you will be served. we waited for a good 20 min and then i just asked a very nice and polite servant if i did everything correctly and when we will be served. he said all is ok and they just have too many orders at this time but he said i will help. suggestion to the higher management. all orders numbers have to be on one of the displays otherwise there are no feedback to the paid clients and with a less passionate clients you may have issues. what is for sure is that this situation decreases efficiency of the floor workers since the current state of kiosk order processing creates a situation in which ppl will be asking questions that can easily be fixed by software upgrade!! mccheers!!! ;-)->:positive"

27172,"terrible customer service.....ordered from the kiosk, was the only person waiting at the counter and not one person acknowledged me. to make matters worse, the manager was assisting in fulfilling orders instead of delegating her employees. while they stood and had conversation i waited 15 min before i received a ""did you order?"" not even the management acknowledged me....can't expect good service if the management doesn't know how to give it!->:negative"

26710,"this mcdonald's screws up 96% of the time! tonight was the last straw. my husband ordered 2 large fries, 2 plain mcchickens, and 2 large drinks.....the drinks were great.....the rest was not even what he ordered and old. in the bag was a fillet o fish (which to my surprise was the only fresh thing), 2 medium 5 year old fries, and 2- 10 year old cheeseburgers...seriously, the cheeseburgers were so old the cheese was crusting. where is the quality????? they don't care if people are upset and/or get food poisoning?? granted my husband should have checked the bag before leaving, but he didn't think to (not surprised). i was definitely upset the order was wrong and said whatever and we were going to eat it because we basically got smaller fries, but an extra sandwich, but those cheeseburgers were so horrendous that whoever put that order together should be fired because it was just wrong..meat and cheese was well past shelf life and the pics i upload will show it. way to go mcdonald's for providing poor service yet again.->:negative"

29246,"updated review 2022: this really is a great mcdonald's. maybe if you don't appreciate it, you haven't been around. the grounds are clean, i saw the manager (chris) picking up trash around the store. they wear nice uniforms and there was an employee cleaning tables as soon as they were vacant. a very nice lady on morning shift was bringing orders to the table ya'll. it was much busier at night so a longer wait but considering there are dozens of hotels nearby, i think service is pretty fast. (2019 review) i went here three times during my stay in the area and the food was always hot, place clean and staff prompt and courteous. got a fabulous greeting memorial day morning.->:positive"

3286,nice location with the usual menu on offer.->:positive
1981,"the best thing about this mcdonald's is the cleanliness compared to most mcd restaurants in queens. the worst thing about it is the staff. they pay no mind to customers waiting in line to have their order taken even when it isn't even busy in the slightest. sometime they don't give me my receipt. sometime my order will be ready in the bag, but they'll set it aside, and realize it much later, as i watch them complete other orders wondering why mine is taking too long, and it turns out my order was read all along, they just never bother to call the number. i can go on and on... almost everyday it's something different. two stars is the best i can do.->:negative"
21184,this mcdonald's is okay is located right next to harrah's casino convenient but the sweet tea was not really that sweet they don't really do bundle deals i'm from the south. i had to wait over 20 minutes for my 20 piece and another lady next to me was waiting on hers it wasn't the cashier's fault but her back crew never drop them but overall i like the mcdonald's like i said it's okay->:negative
