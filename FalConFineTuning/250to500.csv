tourists who get folks coming to them asking for money i suggest trying to offer food to them is more important then money. one thing about dc is there is alot of resources for folks who need money for bus fare or anything can find. food too they know where to go. it's up to them to make that move. another major situation i noticed is the mcdonald's need some updating. i might know why they keep
